# Neural Networks 

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:
- building a regression model using Pytorch 


### To Do
- Exercise where you applied have to build a NN model for the datasets we have already seen in previously ("airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv" and "Regression Analysis Data.csv")
