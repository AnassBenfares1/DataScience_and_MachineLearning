# Colab and Python Notebooks

## Lab structure

- Introductions
- Brief overview of the [Moodle page for the course](https://moodle.unil.ch/course/view.php?id=27761), the Slack channel, the Git repository
  - Brief intro on how to use Slack. Everyone please join [the class Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/datasciencema-l7g7330/shared_invite/zt-23njnf5hu-7Hl5AooM1iE4sAy5Tx2~XA). We will use Slack for all course-related communications outside the class & lab.
  - **Slack Exercise** (everyone): Post a message under `#general` introducing yourself, where you are from and a fun fact about you.
- **[Walkthrough](https://github.com/michalis0/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/Week_2/Week_2.ipynb)**: introduction of Google Colab, Pandas & Data visualization.

## What is covered in the [lab of week 2](https://github.com/michalis0/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/Week_2/Week_2.ipynb)

- Basic operations with pandas [(Pandas' documentation)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- Data visualiztation with pandas and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Additional resources (optional)
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
- Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code. When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Check out [this noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)
    
## Python [todo at home]
Python will be the main programming language we will be using throughout this course. If you feel like you need to review some basics about Python, you can follow this [Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) from Kaggle.
