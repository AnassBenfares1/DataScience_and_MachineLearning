# Text Analytics 

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:

- Present the Kaggle competition project 
- Text Preparation (e.g. tokenization, lemmatization)
- Text Representation (e.g. Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- An example of Text Classification

### Walkthrough
Follow the notebook "Text_Analytics.ipynb". Sentiment analysis.

### Exercise
Download an ready-made classifier for sentiment from Huggingface and compare it's accuracy and F1-score to the classifier you built in the walkthrough (for the same data). Which one is better and by how much?
