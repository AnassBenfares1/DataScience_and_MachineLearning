# Introduction to Pandas and Data Cleaning
This week you will learn how to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a fast and powerful library for data analysis and manipulation in Python.
We will also quickly explain the assignment question 1 to 3 and how to clone a repository. 

## Lab structure
- Explanation of the [Assignment question 1 to 3](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment_Q1_to_Q3_2022): 
   - The question 1 to 3 are released and are available in Moodle. 
- Explanation on how to clone a repository from Git by using "GitHub desktop".
- 2 walkthroughs including a couple of practical exercises:
   - Go through [this notebook, named 'Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb'](Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb) to learn how to **load datasets** in different formats (csv, json) into a Pandas dataframe
   - Follow [this notebook, named 'Data_Cleaning_in_Pandas.ipynb'](Data_Cleaning_in_Pandas.ipynb) to review how to do **data cleaning** with Pandas.
   
- brief intro to the [Data Cleaning in Pandas Summary Sheet](DataCleaning%20in%20Pandas%20Summary.pdf)

## What will be covered?

- load a CSV and JSON file to a Pandas dataframe
- do some basic selection/filtering operations with Pandas (columns and rows)
- convert columns datatypes
- remove rows with null/missing values

## To Do [at home]:

- Follow [this notebook, named 'Loading_Data_WebAPI.ipynb'](Loading_Data_WebAPI.ipynb) to learn how to obtain data from a web api.

- Complete all the walkthroughs and **exercises** in the [Selecting Subsets](Selecting%20Subsets) folder. This is a more detailed presentation than during the lab. By going over these notebooks you will learn how to filter your dataframe by rows or columns and also how to select a subset of a dataframe. So make sure to do so, as these operations are very important in data analysis. (_Note that you should load the data with the raw links from Github if you want to run these notebooks in colab_)

- Complete these tutorials in Kaggle about [data cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values). 

## To Do For Next Week:
For next week, you should be familiar with:
- all the pandas functions we have seen during the labs 
- all the functions present in the exercises
- all the functions in the [Data Cleaning in Pandas Summary Sheet](DataCleaning%20in%20Pandas%20Summary.pdf)

**Also, work on the [assignment](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment_Q1_to_Q3_2022)! Overall, it will require some time, so you shoud start asap.**
